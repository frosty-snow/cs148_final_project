# cs148_final_project
This is the code for my final project in Database Design for Web class (CS148). In this project I worked with one teammate, who was responsible for all front-end work, while I was responsible for all backend work. I built all CRUD functionality for the activities, login and password verfication (salted and hashed), and designed the database structure.
